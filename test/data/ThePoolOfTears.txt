'CURIOUSER and curiouser!' cried Alice. (She was so surprised that she forgot to speak good English.)
'Now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'
(For when she looked down at her heet, they seemed so far away that they were almost out of sight.)
'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and socks for you now, dears?
I'm sure I shall be too far off to trouble myself about you - you must manage the best way you can!'

Just at this moment her head bumped against the roof of the hall. In fact she was now almost nine feet hight,
and she at once took up the golden key and hurried to the garden door.

But it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with on eye.
To get through the door was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.

'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a big girl like you, to go on crying like this.
Stop it at once!' But she went on just the same, crying gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her,
about four inches deep and reaching half way down the hall.

After a time she heard the beating of little feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see who was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other.
He trotted along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Won't she be
savage if I've kept her waiting!'
